# Sales Invoice Print Template - Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified & Resolved

### ❌ **Issue 1: Advanced Amount Showing 0**
**Problem:** The print template was using `$sale->advance_payment` but the actual database field is `$sale->advance_received`

**Solution:** Updated the template to use the correct field name:
```php
// Before (Incorrect)
{{ number_format($sale->advance_payment) }}

// After (Fixed)  
{{ number_format($sale->advance_received) }}
```

### ❌ **Issue 2: Fixed 3 Rows in Items Table**
**Problem:** The template always showed minimum 3 rows even if customer bought fewer items

**Solution:** Removed the forced minimum rows logic:
```php
// Before (Fixed 3 rows)
@if($sale->saleItems->count() < 3)
    @for($i = $sale->saleItems->count(); $i < 3; $i++)
    <tr>
        <td>{{ $i + 1 }}</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        ...empty cells...
    </tr>
    @endfor
@endif

// After (Dynamic rows)
@foreach($sale->saleItems as $index => $item)
<tr>
    <td>{{ $index + 1 }}</td>
    <td>{{ $item->product->name }}</td>
    ...actual data...
</tr>
@endforeach
```
