# Stock Validation System Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive stock validation system implemented across the Dream Electronics management system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Validation (StoreSaleRequest)
- ✅ Custom validation rule checks product stock before sale creation
- ✅ Validates each item's quantity against available stock
- ✅ Provides detailed error messages with product name and stock levels

### 2. Controller-Level Validation (SaleController)
- ✅ Double-check stock availability before processing sale
- ✅ Detailed error response for AJAX requests
- ✅ Safe stock decrement with additional validation
- ✅ Proper error handling and rollback on validation failure

### 3. Frontend Real-time Validation (JavaScript)
- ✅ Real-time stock validation as user types quantity
- ✅ Visual feedback with Bootstrap validation classes (is-valid/is-invalid)
- ✅ Automatic quantity adjustment when exceeding stock
- ✅ Prevents form submission with invalid quantities
- ✅ Stock information display in product selection

### 4. API Enhancement (ProductController)
- ✅ Stock check endpoint: GET /products/{product}/stock
- ✅ Returns current stock levels and availability status
- ✅ Can be used for real-time stock checking

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Add Stock via StockCredit
1. Go to Stock Credit module
2. Add inventory for a product (e.g., 10 units)
3. Verify product.stock_quantity is updated

### Test 2: Valid Sale Creation
1. Go to Sales → Create New Sale
2. Select product with available stock
3. Enter quantity ≤ available stock
4. Complete sale
5. Verify stock is decremented correctly

### Test 3: Overselling Prevention (Frontend)
1. Go to Sales → Create New Sale  
2. Select product with limited stock (e.g., 5 units)
3. Try to enter quantity > available stock (e.g., 8 units)
4. Verify:
   - Input shows red validation state
   - Error message displays
   - Form cannot be submitted

### Test 4: Overselling Prevention (Backend)
1. Use browser dev tools or Postman
2. Try to submit sale with quantity > available stock
3. Verify:
   - 422 validation error returned
   - Detailed error message with stock levels
   - No sale is created
   - Stock levels remain unchanged

### Test 5: Stock Display Accuracy
1. Check that product dropdowns show current stock levels
2. Verify stock information updates after sales
3. Confirm stock information is accurate across modules

## Expected Behavior

### Valid Sale Flow:
1. User selects product → Stock info displayed
2. User enters valid quantity → Green validation
3. Form submits → Backend validates → Sale created → Stock decremented

### Invalid Sale Flow:
1. User selects product → Stock info displayed  
2. User enters excessive quantity → Red validation + error message
3. Form submission blocked OR backend returns 422 error
4. No sale created, stock unchanged

## Error Messages

- Frontend: "Requested quantity (X) exceeds available stock (Y)"
- Backend: "Item N: ProductName - Requested quantity (X) exceeds available stock (Y)"

This system ensures complete inventory protection across all entry points.
